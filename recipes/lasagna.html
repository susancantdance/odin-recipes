    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="https://thecozycook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lasagna-Recipe.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
